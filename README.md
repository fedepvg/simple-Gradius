## Bio

My name's Franco and I'm a game dev enthusiast who is currently studying Programming (and Game Design) so one day I can put all my effort and time in the videogames industry, which is constantly rising. I'm a beginner in Programming but I'm trying my best to make the best experiences possible as well as keeping the code nice and clean.
